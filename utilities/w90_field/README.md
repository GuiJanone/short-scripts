# Wannier90 to XATU interface

This program reads a `seedname_tb.dat` file from Wannier90 and outputs a `field_tb.dat` with a electric field applied on the `z` direction

### Compilation:
To compile the program, navigate to the w90_field directory and run:
```
$ make
```

### Running the Program:
The program requires the `seedname_tb.dat` file produced by Wannier90 as input. Please make sure the file remains unmodified (i.e., do not add or remove any lines from it).

To run the program, use the following command:
```
./wannier2xatu.x [FILE_WANNIER_90_tb.dat]
```
Replace `[FILE_WANNIER_90_tb.dat]` with the path to your actual `seedname_tb.dat` file.

### Notes:
Ensure that the input file format is strictly followed as generated by Wannier90.
The output will be a `field_tb.dat`.

### How it works

It takes the position matrix elements of the wannier basis to compute

```math
H = H_0 - eE_z \langle \alpha \mathbf{0} | \hat{r}_z |\alpha ' \mathbf{R}\rangle
```
